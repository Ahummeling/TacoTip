# TacoTip
Better player tooltips - class colors, talents/specialization, GearScore &amp; more - for Classic / TBC / WoTLK 

NOTE: While this release v0.0.1 is functional, it is not final. Optimizations, fixes and code cleanup for WoTLK to be added when WoTLK is released.
LibGearScore & LibClassicInspector are to be put into proper libraries later so their data can be used by other addons too.

Any input / feedback is welcome !
